title: "Request a contract review"
---

There is a group of Clarity developers that are offering to review your smart contracts.

In order to request a review:
1. prepare your contract so that `clarinet console` runs successfully from the root of the folder
1. open an issue on [github]({{<githubref>}}/issues/new) providing information about the contract and the expected outcome of the review (informal feedback, formal report, etc.) and your price offer.

One reviewer will get assigned and continues the conversation.
