The effected contract was {{<contractref v1-1 SP2C2YFP12AJZB4MABJBAJ55XECVS7E4PMMZ89YZR arkadiko-swap-v1-1>}}. In the updated version, new swapping pairs can only added by the admin. In addition, a shut down flag was added. 

The comparison between the two contracts can be studied at git commit {{<githubcommit 82c8c4740b79b06f6dffe0b9484ccc11984a7f7f>}}.
