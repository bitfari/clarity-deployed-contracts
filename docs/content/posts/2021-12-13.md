On Dec 13th, there were two suspicous contracts deployed that interacted with the {{<contractref "byzantion marketplace v5" SP2KAF9RF86PVX3NEE27DFV1CQX0T4WGR41X3S45C byzantion-market-v5>}} contract and was named as stacks-art-market:
{{<contractref "bad actor 1" SP5YF41VPG2FZ8NYK4GYGJXNFVSRPKWH26402X1T stacks-art-market-v1>}},
{{<contractref "bad actor 2" SP5YF41VPG2FZ8NYK4GYGJXNFVSRPKWH26402X1T stacks-art-market-v2>}}.

It turned out that the two contracts together could extract 1644 STX from the escrow of open bids that were not placed by the attacker.

A new version of byzantion marketplace has been deployed since that prevents these exploits. Read more about the [byzantion marketplace]({{<ref "protocols/byzantion.md">}}) protocol.
